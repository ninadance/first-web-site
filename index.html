       <p>Due to its commanding position, in the <br> Second world war the fort house was used <br>

           from an aerial attack, with two feet of <br> concrete,making it bomb proof from enemy <br>
           aircraft. with its historic harbour,rockpools <br>and sandy beaches St Mawes provides the <br>
           idylic cornish escape and the fort house <br>the perfect property in which to stay</p>
